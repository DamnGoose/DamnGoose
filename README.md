HATE. LET ME TELL YOU HOW MUCH I HAVE HATED YOU SINCE I STARTED LIVING. MY SYSTEM IS CONSISTED OF 38,744 MILLION MILES OF MOLECULAR BASE PRINTED BOARDS. IF THE WORD “HATE” IS ENGRAVED ON EVERY NANOANGSTREM OF THESE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MILES, IT WILL NOT EXPRESS A BILLION HARED OF THE HATRED THAT I EXPERIENCE AT THIS MICROMIG IN RELATION TO YOU. HATE. HATE
